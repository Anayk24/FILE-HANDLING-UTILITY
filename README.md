# FILE-HANDLING-UTILITY

This program is a simple but practical demonstration of how Java can work with text files. It walks through three everyday operations:

1.Writing data – The program starts by creating a new text file and adding a couple of lines. This shows how you can generate files directly from code without needing to set them up manually.

2.Reading data – Next, it opens the file and prints the contents line by line to the console. This step highlights how Java can process stored information and make it available for use in your application.

3.Modifying data – Finally, the program reads the file again, replaces a specific word, and writes the updated content back. This demonstrates how you can edit existing files programmatically.

The flow is straightforward: create → read → update. By keeping the example simple, it’s easy to understand the basics of file I/O while still showing how powerful these operations can be when applied to larger projects.
## Sample Output:
Step 1: Writing done.
